## Intention:

- Hide all numerial figure from general tab 
(except one in the canvas that is dynamically generated <- still looking for a way to cover this, as of current, walk around it by hide the entry level all together).

- Add in multiple keyboard short cut to help with the work flow

- My choice of personal data base is Notion: <- utilise their API to automatically transfer log over.

## Todo:
