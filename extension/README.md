# **Extension folder**: Contain all file require that allow to load this (draft version) to chrome.

## Intention:

- Hide all numerial figure from general tab 
(except one in the canvas that is dynamically generated <- still looking for a way to cover this, as of current, walk around it by hide the entry level all together).

- Add in multiple keyboard short cut to help with the work flow

- My choice of personal data base is Notion: <- utilise their API to automatically transfer log over.
## Requirement:
must have 2 workspace:
### 1. name:"EUR_USD"
    - contain: 3 window 
    - 1st: main work space with chart 
    - 3rd: the position tab
### 2. name:"History
    - contain history window
